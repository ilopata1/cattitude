## Managing Pages
Pages let you group widgets by task—navigation, engines, energy, weather, racing, night watch, and more. This guide covers creating, organizing, and editing pages, plus an overview of available widget types.


## Pages Panel
Reveal the toolbar and tap the **Manage pages** button (the wrench next to the page icons).

Here you can:
- Add a new page (+ button)
- Reorder pages (drag a page card, with touch or mouse)
- Rename, change the icon, duplicate, or delete a page — **tap or click the page card** to open its menu, then choose **Edit** (rename + icon), **Duplicate**, or **Delete**

Choose icons that reflect each page’s purpose (e.g. compass for navigation, droplet for tanks, bolt for power). Icons appear wherever pages are listed.

### Gesture / Action Summary
| Action                        | Touch / Mobile        | Mouse / Desktop        | Keyboard                          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Add a page                    | Tap (+)               | Click (+)              | Focus (+), press Enter/Space      |
| Reorder pages                 | Drag a page card      | Drag a page card       | —                                 |
| Rename / duplicate / delete   | Tap a page → menu     | Click a page → menu    | Focus a page, Enter/Space → menu  |

The page's menu offers **Edit** (rename + change icon), **Duplicate**, and **Delete** (Delete asks you to confirm).


## Editing Page Layouts
1. Go to the page you want to change (swipe sideways, scroll horizontally, or tap its icon in the toolbar’s page navigator).
2. Reveal the toolbar (swipe down from the top, scroll up, or tap the top peek strip).
3. Tap the edit button (the pen) to unlock the page — or press **E** on a keyboard.

In edit mode, widgets show dashed outlines, and the toolbar swaps to an "Editing layout" label with **Cancel** and **Done** buttons (Done sits in the pen's former slot). The page navigator is hidden while editing, so finish (Done/Cancel) before switching pages.

### What You Can Do in Edit Mode
- Add a widget (tap empty space → Add Widget)
- Move a widget (drag)
- Resize a widget (drag edges/corners)
- Configure, duplicate, or delete a widget (tap it → action menu; Delete asks to confirm)
- **Save** changes (Done) or **discard** them (Cancel, or press **Esc**) — both are in the toolbar while editing

>**Tip:** If you can’t add a widget, free up space by resizing or moving existing ones first.

## Viewing Widget History on a Locked Page
When a page is locked (normal viewing mode), you can open a history graph for a widget without entering edit mode: **press and hold (long-press)** the widget.

Skip opens a history graph dialog and loads historical series data for that widget using the History API. Only widgets bound to numeric data have a history — long-pressing anything else does nothing.


## Workflow: From Idea to Page
1. Define the purpose (e.g. “Night Nav” = heading, COG, SOG, depth, wind, batteries, minimal brightness)
2. Create or duplicate a page similar to what you want
3. Enter edit mode and add required widgets
4. Configure each widget’s data paths (keep sample times reasonable to reduce churn)
5. Arrange and size for readability at your viewing distance
6. Exit edit mode and test switching at real brightness/environment


## Widget Gallery (Overview)
Skip widgets turn Signal K data into readable visuals and controls. Available widget types:

- **Numeric** – Displays numeric data in a clear and concise format, with options to show min/max values and a background mini graph for trends.
- **Text** – Displays text data with customizable color formatting.
- **Date & Time** – Shows date and time with custom formatting and timezone correction.
- **Position** – Displays latitude and longitude for location tracking and navigation.
- **Static Label** – Add customizable labels to organize and clarify your dashboard layout.
- **Zones State Panel**: Monitor the health/state of path data. Each panel control displays path data severity and status messages (driven by Signal K metadata zones).
- **Switch Panel** – Group of toggle switches, indicator lights, and press buttons for digital switching and operations. See [Digital Switching and PUT Path Setup](#/help/putcontrols.md).
- **Slider** – Range slider for adjusting values (e.g. lighting intensity). See [Digital Switching and PUT Path Setup](#/help/putcontrols.md).
- **Multi State Switch** - Lists all available device/path operating modes/states (e.g., On, Off, Charge Only, Invert Only), highlights the current state, and lets you select a new state to send to the device and see the result. See [Digital Switching and PUT Path Setup](#/help/putcontrols.md).
- **Compact Linear** – Simple horizontal linear gauge with a large value label and modern look.
- **Linear** – Horizontal or vertical linear gauge with zone highlighting.
- **Radial** – Radial gauge with configurable dials and zone highlighting.
- **Compass** – Rotating compass gauge with multiple cardinal indicator options.
- **Level Gauge** – Dual-scale heel angle indicator for trim tuning and sea-state monitoring.
- **Pitch & Roll** – Horizon-style attitude indicator showing live pitch and roll degrees.
- **Classic Steel** – Traditional steel-look linear & radial gauges with range sizes and zone highlights.
- **Windsteer** – Combines wind, wind sectors, heading, COG, and waypoint info for wind steering.
- **Wind Trends** – Real-time True Wind trends with dual axes for direction and speed, live values, and averages.
- **Battery Monitor** - Display batteries or whole banks state State of Charge, remaining capacity, remaining time, voltage, current, power flow, and temperature.

### Need a Widget Not Listed Here?

- Check the community first: someone may already have a reusable setup or branch.
- If you are a developer, see [Contributing Widgets](#/help/contributing-widgets.md) for the contribution path.
- If you only need external visuals, consider [The Embed Page Viewer](#/help/embedwidget.md) for web dashboards.

## Performance & Layout Tips
- Favor clarity over cramming: leave space around high‑priority values
- Group related widgets (navigation, energy, engines, environment)
- Use consistent units per page (e.g. all speeds in knots, all temps in °C or °F—don’t mix)
- For night pages, adjust brightness or use the all‑red theme in Menu → Settings → Display
- Duplicate a working layout before making major changes (easy rollback)
- Keep sampling intervals modest (1000 ms+) unless fast reaction is essential
- Know your device’s hardware limits and adjust widget count per page accordingly
- Avoid embedding too many external webpages—each adds load


## Troubleshooting
| Issue                  | Possible Cause                        | Fix                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data shows “—” or blank| Path missing/not configured/null value | Open widget config, verify Signal K path exists and updates. Use the Signal K Data Browser to view raw data from the server. |
| Wrong units            | Server display-unit preference, or a per-widget override | Skip shows units from the Signal K server's unit preferences by default; to override for one widget, edit its config paths and set the desired target unit. |
| Slow page switching    | Excessive data sampling/too many widgets| Increase sample times; remove unused widgets. Split widgets into separate pages. Optimize system resource usage. |
| Embedded page blank    | Cross‑origin blocked                   | See "Embed Page Viewer" help section.                               |
| History dialog not opening on a locked page | The page is still in edit mode, or the widget has no numeric data | Lock the page first, then press and hold the widget. Only numeric‑data widgets have a history. |
